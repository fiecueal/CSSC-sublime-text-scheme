# CSSColors Color Scheme

An attempt at making a functional light color scheme while limiting the used colors to the [defined CSS/HTML colors.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color#value).

The only times the colors were modified are for:
1. **line highlight** lowered alpha so text backgrounds remain visible on the current line
2. **strings** lowered lightness because all the named green colors stand out too much

Ever so slightly takes inspiration from (and started as an edited version of) the [Alabaster Color Scheme](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster). This scheme is more mild than others but not as sparse as the Alabaster schemes.
